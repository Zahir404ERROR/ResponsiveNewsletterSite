                                </h3>
                                <h4 class="h4-inside">The 'buds would likely be cheaper than the OnePlus Buds Pro but still keep ANC.</h4>
                                <p>Tomorrow, the OnePlus Buds Pro officially go on sale. For $150, you get the best ‘buds the company has to offer, with active noise-cancellation (ANC) and a claimed total of 38 hours of battery life with its included case.However,
                                    leaker Max Jambor took to Twitter recently and claimed a new set could be in the works. Jambor suggests these unannounced earbuds could also feature ANC but cut down the price.
                                    <br><br> Jambor’s suggestion that these could be “some sort of Lite edition of the Buds Pro” sounds confusing, but that’s kind of OnePlus’ earbuds portfolio in a nutshell. If this rumor is true, we’d expect OnePlus
                                    to cut out some of the more premium features of the Buds Pro — such as the wireless charging case, for example — and keep just the essentials. If OnePlus could deliver a set of ANC earbuds for under $150, it would not
                                    only undercut its own Buds Pro but also the just-launched Galaxy Buds 2. Samsung’s ‘buds come in at the same $150 price as the Buds Pro, so OnePlus might feel the need to respond. Let’s hope that these new earbuds land
                                    as something simple, like the OnePlus Buds 2. But hey, we wouldn’t put it past the company to launch them as the OnePlus Buds Z Pro Lite or something.

                                <p>Microsoft has just announced that Windows 11 will arrive on October 5. It’s been a while since Microsoft announced the next major version of the Windows operating system. Currently, the new version is being beta-tested
                                    through the Windows Insider program. Eligible Windows 10 PCs will start getting the free upgrade from that date. Additionally, new PCs with Windows 11 will start being available for purchase on October 5, Microsoft
                                    has announced in a new blog post. There’s a major catch with this launch though. Windows 11 will not come with native Android app support when it arrives.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Microsoft has highlighted a bunch of the features that Windows 11 will ship with at launch. These include the new design, Snap Layouts, an updated Start menu, Microsoft Teams integration, and more.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> However, the notable exception is one of those that many of us have been looking forward to. This launch will include the new Microsoft Store, but the company says it is still working on its journey to bring Android
                                    apps to Windows 11.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Aaron Woodman, general manager of Windows marketing at Microsoft, noted that the Android app support, which is being developed in collaboration with Amazon and Intel, will begin testing through the Windows Insider
                                    Program over the coming months. The announcement also emphasizes that Windows 11 will be rolled out in a “phased and measured approach.” So while this feature being absent at launch may be a disappointment to some,
                                    Microsoft says it’s focusing on quality, so we can expect the final product to work well.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> In the meantime, if you would like to install Windows 11 on an older unsupported PC, you will need to use an ISO to manually install it, and potentially lose access to Windows updates in the future.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Windows 11 native Android app support should arrive sometime in 2022, according to reasonable estimates.

                                <p>Update: August 31, 2021 (6:57 PM ET): According to a fresh report by Bloomberg, Apple’s plan to bring satellite connectivity to iPhones will be focused on emergency situations only. It should allow users to send texts to
                                    first responders and report incidents like crashes in areas that have low or no cellular connectivity.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Apple is said to be preparing two such emergency features that will rely on satellite connectivity. These features will show up in future iPhones but it’s not certain if those will belong to the iPhone 13 series.
                                    The emergency messaging feature will be integrated into the Messages apps alongside standard SMS and iMessage options. It will restrict messages to a shorter length.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The second feature will allow reporting major emergencies, such as plane crashes and sinking ships, also using satellite networks. Additionally, the service may eventually be able to handle some phone calls too.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Original article: August 30, 2021 (3:58 AM ET): According to a new rumor from a reliable Apple tipster, the iPhone 13 could bring support for low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, bolstering its connectivity abilities
                                    in areas with limited coverage. The tip stems from reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, quoted by MacRumors, and points to the use of a “customized Qualcomm X60” modem that supports LEO satellites across the iPhone
                                    13 line. This would allow the phones to place calls or send texts even if no cellular service is available.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> iPhone 13 and LEO satellites: img?
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Apple’s reported use of LEO satellites wouldn’t be a replacement for 4G and 5G networks, but they would allow users to communicate with others even if there’s no immediate cellular coverage. This would be hugely
                                    beneficial for those in rural areas or those nowhere near ground stations.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> While high-speed internet is also possible using LEO satellites, it’s unclear if this use case is a priority for Apple. Starlink is one of the newest and arguably the most widely known LEO satellite-based internet
                                    providers at present. The company claims top speeds of up to 1Gbps with latency between 25ms and 35ms. It’s unclear which satellites the iPhone 13 could support, but American satellite communications operator Globalstar
                                    is apparently in the running.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Kuo also reportedly adds that Apple may bring this technology to future devices beyond phones, including cars.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Whether the LEO satellite tip holds any water remains to be seen. Kuo has a solid track record, but we’d still recommend waiting for Apple’s official iPhone 13 announcement, which could come as early as September
                                    14. Beyond possible networking buffs, the iPhone 13 is said to bring improvements to its camera array, including autofocus for its ultra-wide shooter. Also mooted is an under-display fingerprint sensor beneath an always-on
                                    display.

                                    Updated, September 10, 2021 (05:00 PM): After a problematic week with people missing alarms on their Android phones, it appears the problem is finally fixed. According to a post from a Google rep on Reddit (via Android Police), the issue won’t happen
                                    anymore if you update both the Google Clock app and Spotify. Since the weekend is coming up, this might be the perfect time to do some tests to see if you can once again depend on this app to deliver your alarms.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Original article, September 9, 2021 (04:23 PM ET): Google’s official Clock app for Android may still be failing to set off alarms as expected despite a Wednesday update, leaving it a risky choice for people who
                                    want to use it to wake up.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The update, 6.4.1, has improved the app in that it will generally default to a stock Android tone if Spotify integration fails, according to Play Store reviews caught by Android Police. Some users are still complaining
                                    about missed alarms, however. If they are using the 6.4.1 release, that suggests that Google hasn’t fully patched the issue.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The glitch seems to have begun with an earlier app update. This prompted a flurry of criticism, culminating in a Reddit post in which Google said it had identified the cause and was preparing a fix. In the interim,
                                    it suggested using system sounds for alarms.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> A lot of people prefer waking up to their own music, of course, and Spotify hooks would normally make this convenient. Until Google finds a permanent solution, it’s probably safer to use a third-party app.

                                <h4 class="h4-inside">Vivo's upgraded flagship series builds on the photography pedigree of its predecessor.
                                </h4>
                                <p>
                                    After weeks of teasers and leaks, Vivo’s freshest range-topping smartphone series is now official. The new Vivo X70 series builds on the X60 series‘ focus on photography and introduces a refreshed design and upgraded internals.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Aesthetically, the X70 series isn’t a fundamental rework of the X60 line. The devices now feature a new finishing effect using a “crystallized glass with a prismatic surface” that shimmers under light. The Vivo
                                    X70 and X70 Pro feature slightly tweaked rear camera designs, too, with the flash now sitting vertically and separately from the sensor array. The range-topping X70 Pro Plus also gains a more prominent camera hump mounted
                                    in a protective “ceramic window” that doubles as a selfie mirror.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The Vivo X70 Pro Plus also rings the most changes in terms of specs, too. The most apparent upgrade is the larger, curved 6.78-inch AMOLED display, made by Samsung. It also packs variable refresh rate support from
                                    1Hz to 120Hz, 3,200 x 1,440 resolution, 1,500 nits of peak brightness, and 10-bit color support.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> A 32MP camera is mounted in a punch hole and is a design trait also shared by the entire range.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> What isn’t, though, is the X70 Pro Plus’ quad-camera array. It melds a high-transmittance lens with a 50MP Samsung GN1 sensor in its primary camera. It’s joined by a 48MP 114-degree ultra-wide gimbal shooter, which
                                    brings Vivo’s 360-degree Horizon Leveling Stabilization smarts. This feature effectively works to keep the shot in an upright orientation even if the phone is moving or rotating. These cameras are supported by a 12MP
                                    portrait shooter and an 8MP periscope camera with 60x zoom, both of which pack OIS. Vivo’s self-developed V1 imaging chip also brings additional noise reduction and MEMC effects to the camera array.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Zeiss’ involvement is also more apparent in the camera software. The firm is bringing three new Style Portrait flavors inspired by historic lenses. This includes anamorphic Distagon, and bokeh-heavy Planar and
                                    Sonnar effects. Several shooting modes, including Pro Cinematic Mode, Super Night Video, and Pure Night View, are also included.

                                    Amazon is doubling down on its streaming TV business. Today, the retailer confirmed previous rumors that it will sell its own branded smart televisions with its Fire TV OS installed. One is a premium TV lineup, the Fire TV Omni series, while the other
                                    is a budget-themed model line, the 4-Series.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The Omni series will include hands-free access to Alexa voice commands. In other words, you won’t need a remote to use voice features with this TV. In fact, the Fire TV Omni series will include support for special
                                    Alexa commands later this year. It will allow owners to say “Alexa, what should I watch?”, and the TV will then show series and movie recommendations.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The Omni TVs will also support Live View Picture-in-Picture, so you can, for example, see live camera feeds on your smart doorbell. It will also support Alexa Calling, and later this year the Fire TV Omni series
                                    will add Zoom call support.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The TVs will be available in many display sizes: 43-inch, 50-inch, 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch models. All will support 4K Ultra HD resolution and HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Digital Plus support. The 65-inch and 75-inch
                                    models have a smaller bezel size, and they also add support for the Dolby Vision HDR standard.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> You can pre-order all the Fire TV Omni models now, with shipments scheduled to begin on October 27. Prices range from $409.99 to $1099.99 for the 75-inch model.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Amazon also announced the budget-themed Fire TV 4-series today. These smart TVs support Alexa voice commands via its remote control. They also support 4K resolutions with HDR10 and HLG support. They come in 43-inch,
                                    50-inch, and 55-inch models, with prices ranging from $369.99 to $519.99. The TVs also begin shipping on October 27, with pre-orders now available.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> In addition to its own Fire TV Omni and 4-Series, Amazon announced that Pioneer will release Fire TV OS-based smart televisions this fall. Toshiba also plans to release hands-free Alexa voice-supported Fire OS
                                    smart televisions starting in the spring of 2022.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The newest member of the Fire TV streaming device family was also announced today, for people who own high-end TVs that don’t have that OS. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max uses a Mediatek MT7921LS 1.8GHz processor, along
                                    with 2GB of RAM, that helps it perform 40% faster than the current Fire TV Stick 4K. That means loading and launching apps should be much faster. It supports 4K resolution of course, along with HDR, HDR10+, Dolby Vision,
                                    and Dolby Atmos. It also supports Live View Picture-in-Picture and voice commands via its remote. Finally, it’s the first Amazon Fire TV device to support Wi-Fi 6, which means faster download speeds and connections
                                    with Wi-Fi 6 wireless routers. It’s available for pre-order for $54.99, and ships on October 7. You can also bundle it with Amazon’s Luna streaming game controller for $99.99.

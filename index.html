                Apple’s biggest launch event of the year is likely coming soon. Today, the company announced it will hold an online event on Tuesday, September 14. It’s highly expected that the team at Cupertino will feature the iPhone 13 reveal as the biggest part of

            </h2>
            <p style="margin: 1% 3%; text-align: justify;">
                The global chipset shortage has had a profound impact in 2021, with some OEMs struggling to meet demand in the wake of the pandemic. But this crisis could take a turn for the worse, especially for consumers. A new report suggests that chipsets, therefore
                smartphones, could be further compounded by higher prices as increased production fees come into effect next year.
                <br><br> According to a Nikkei Asia report, Taiwanese semiconductor firm TSMC — the manufacturer of chipsets used by Apple, Qualcomm, and Nvidia — is set to hike its production fees by as much as 20% in 2022. The increase is reportedly
                due to several factors, from overwhelming demand and logistics to the race for smaller manufacturing processes. These pressures are being felt by other chipmakers, too.
                <br><br> The report also suggests that Qualcomm and MediaTek‘s cost of sales have ballooned by 60% and 64% between October 2020 and June 2021. This inflated cost, alongside the shortage, will likely have a knock-on effect for consumers,
                who may have to fork out even more for electronics. Smartphone and computer companies reliant on these chipset firm’s products will likely have to spike costs to recoup losses.
                <br><br> Higher prices, more flagships
                <br><br> The spiking prices could also affect smartphone companies’ product lineups too. Nikkei, quoting a Counterpoint analyst, suggests companies may release more high-end products to offset their losses. This would mean fewer new mid-
                and lower-range devices available to budget-limited consumers. Interestingly, increased smartphone prices haven’t been a hot topic in 2021 as in the past. The likes of Samsung actually lowered the price of some of its flagship this year
                compared to the last. The Galaxy S20 series started at $999 in the US, while the Galaxy S21 arrived at $799. It’s possible that the Galaxy S22 won’t continue this trend. Notably, Google also confirmed that its upcoming Pixel 6 Pro would
                be “expensive.” <br>
                <br> The iPhone 13 rumor mill has been at full speed for a while now. Reliable leakers have claimed the iPhone 13 models will include displays with 120Hz refresh rates, a smaller notch on top, and even support for connecting to LEO satellites

            </h2>
            <p style="margin: 1% 3%; text-align: justify;">
                There are two main problems with many foldable phones today, namely the fact that the folding display has a crease and that the plastic top layer of the screen is often softer than traditional smartphone displays made out of glass. Now, LG Chem has announced
                a new type of cover material that promises to address these issues.
                <br><br> The company revealed its so-called ‘Real Folding Window’ technology today, and it takes the form of a specially developed coating atop thin polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic film. LG Chem adds that the material is thinner
                than existing tempered glass but has the same hardness while being as flexible as plastic.
                <br><br> “Unlike existing polyimide films and tempered glass-type materials, the cover window that applied LG Chem’s new coating technologies will maximize flexibility, while also providing optimized solutions for foldable phones such
                as making improvements to chronic issues like fold impressions on the connecting part of the screen (sic),” a company spokesperson said.
                <br><br> LG Chem says durability is “maintained completely” after the Real Folding Window is folded 200,000 times. The company adds that the tech can be used for both in-folding and out-folding displays. The solution also delivers major
                improvements to “fold lines” seen on folding areas of the screen (i.e. it reduces creases).
                <br><br> The company also says it’s working to offer the special coating without the use of plastic film. This presumably opens the door to manufacturers who simply want to beef up their already completed foldable phone designs, akin to
                adding Gorilla Glass.
                <br><br> So when can we buy the first foldable phones with this tech, then? It looks like we’re in for quite a long wait, as LG Chem says it’ll only gain mass-production capabilities in 2022, adding that “full-scale” sales kick off from
                2023. The firm says it’s also looking at expanding beyond phones and applying the tech to laptops and tablets. In saying so, LG Chem noted that it has already received proposals from multiple clients about joint projects.
                <br><br> We’ve asked the company about comparisons to ultra-thin glass in terms of cost and other factors and will update the article accordingly.

            </h2>
            <p style="margin: 1% 3%; text-align: justify;">
                Modular smartphones are incredibly cool, but the design philosophy never really caught on. Sure, brands like Fairphone, LG, and Motorola have launched products to market, and even Google at one point dipped a cautious toe into the pool. But if a company
                launched a modular phone today, would you buy it?
                <br><br> That’s a question we posed to our readers in a recent poll, and the results are now in!
                <br><br> Would you purchase a modular smartphone?
                <br><br> Results
                <br><br> We saw just under 1,900 votes cast on this poll since it went live on September 6. The tally reveals that 69% of respondents would buy a modular smartphone if one were available today. That equates to more than two in every three
                readers. However, some still feel the design philosophy wouldn’t stand up to traditional phones. Around 31% of the voters on this poll wouldn’t bite.
                <br><br> See also: The best phones with a removable battery and alternative solutions
                <br><br> While a fully modular phone would theoretically let users mix and match specific components, it seems some readers want control over some components. Removable batteries or modules that allow for more storage are attractive, in
                a similar vein to LG’s G5 and Motorola’s Moto Mods series. Modular parts would also give buyers more control over replacements or upgrades.
                <br><br> That said, it’s not immediately clear how modular phone design could improve the day-t0-day user experience of today’s smartphone offerings. Would the likely premium for OEMs and consumers be worth it, especially if modern smartphones
                come with most bells and whistles anyway? Well, peruse some of the reader comments on this poll below.

                <br><br> Joe Black: Replaceable battery would be awesome, other than that, I seriously do not care.
                <br><br> needa: The Fairphone is the perfect idea. If they could trim it down, update the processor to something respectable, figure out the massive software issues they face, and sell it in the states… I’d buy it in a heartbeat.
                <br><br> Evie: No, Not even sure how modularity would improve my experience. I need a large screen, decent sound, and a reasonable amount of ram and memory.
                <br><br> Roaduardo: Nothing I’ve seen convinces me that modular phones would work well. If someone can do it and does not need a Kickstarter, like form a proper firm, I’ll take a look and wait a few generations.
                <br><br> Craig Southwick: I would like to say yes. The real answer is a qualified yes. I haven’t seen anything that gives me confidence that this will work. The Motorola try had possibilities but they abandoned it so everyone got burned.
                So I answered no because in the next 2-3 years I am not even considering it.
                <br><br> Fredrik Sedlem: Not in the current form with “Lego pieces.” But stuff is becoming modular if you think outside the box/phone. Storage and processing in the cloud. Smartwatches, smart headphones, power banks, etc.
                <br><br> Jeff Namhie: No. Just put everything I want in one integrated device.
                <br><br>
                <br><br> That’s it for this poll. Thanks for your votes and comments. If you have any thoughts about modular phones or the results of this poll, be sure to drop a line below.

            </h2>
            <p style="margin: 1% 3%; text-align: justify;">
                Xiaomi is set to extend its 11 series family in India this month. According to a new report, the Xiaomi 11 Lite 5G NE could make its debut in September, joining the 4G model launched in June.
                <br><br> Per 91Mobiles, the phone will get a September launch date, but the exact calendar date remains unclear.
                <br><br> What is apparent is that the “New Edition” model will bring 5G connectivity to the market. Additionally, reports also point to the Snapdragon 778G SoC in use, an upgrade over the original 5G model’s Snapdragon 780G. This chipset
                bump would pit the device against the Samsung Galaxy A52s and the Realme GT Master Edition in the sub-Rs 30,000 segment.
                <br><br> As for its other features, the Xiaomi 11 Lite 5G NE could carry similar specs to the Mi 11 Lite 5G available in China and Europe. This would include a 90Hz 6.55-inch AMOLED, a 4,250mAh battery with 33W charging, and a 64MP+8MP+5MP
                rear camera array. Visually, the two devices could share similar design traits and slim bodies.
                <br><br> While the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 4G model brought a price tag of Rs 21,999 (~$299), it’s likely that the more powerful NE model would require a little more cash when it lands.

            </h2>
            <p style="margin: 1% 3%; text-align: justify;">
                Razer on Wednesday launched its latest gaming mouse, the Basilisk V3, highlighted by a four-way scroll wheel and an intensely precise optical sensor.
                <br><br> The former is dubbed the HyperScroll Tilt Wheel, and lets users scroll left or right by tilting rather than rolling, notes XDA. In regular vertical movement the wheel offers tactile, smooth, or automatic modes. Smooth is self-explanatory;
                tactile goes one notch at a time, and automatic shifts between the two previous settings based on how fast you spin. Razer’s Synapse software lets users toggle extra acceleration for fast wheel flicks.
                <br><br> The V3 is equipped with Razer’s Focus+ optical sensor, giving it a peak sensitivity of 26,000dpi. Thankfully this can be scaled back to avoid cursors flying around your desktop. Further along those lines, you can tweak the lift-off
                range of the mouse to avoid accidental input.
                <br><br> Some other perks include 11 customizable buttons, 11 lighting zones, and a six-foot cable designed against tangles.
                <br><br> The Basilisk V3 is now shipping for $69.99 in the US, or €79.99 in Europe.

            </h2>
            <p style="margin: 1% 3%; text-align: justify;">
                We are now into the final stages of the Android 12 rollout. At this point, the operating system is essentially ready for the public, with only a few tweaks left to perform.
                <br><br> The latest: Google puts finishing touches on Android 12 with beta 5
                <br><br> Right now, we have seen the fifth beta launch. Before then, we saw three developer previews (with two minor updates in between) and four betas (with minor updates for each). Google has called the fifth beta a release candidate,
                which means it’s the last one. The next big launch should be the stable launch. Google says that launch will happen in the next few weeks.
                <br><br> For the record, last year for the Android 11 launch, Google had the first beta out in June and the final launch in early September. It is highly likely we’ll see a very similar schedule this year.
                <br><br> Android 12 release date: The timeline so far
                <br><br> Google plans to launch monthly updates for Android 12. According to the most recent official information, we can expect the stable launch to happen in a matter of weeks.
                <br><br> Now that we’ve seen the fifth beta, the Android 12 release date is imminent. Depending on how development goes, it could be at the end of September. It could also be mid-September if things go well. However, the ongoing COVID-19
                pandemic has wreaked havoc on pretty much every industry, so it’s important to temper your expectations.
                <br><br> So far, this is what has officially launched:

            </h2>
            <p style="margin: 1% 3%; text-align: justify;">
                Hulu subscribers will have to pay a bit more to access the streaming service next month. Deadline reports that starting October 8, the price of the service will be going up by $1. That means the ad-supported plan will increase from $5.99 to $6.99 a month,
                and the no-ads tier will go up from $11.99 to $12.99 a month.
                <br><br> Thankfully the price increases do not affect anyone on the Hulu Plus Live TV plans. It also does not affect the prices of the Disney Plus-Hulu-ESPN Plus bundle. It will remain at $13.99 a month with ad-supported Hulu and $18.99
                a month with Hulu with no ads. Since ESPN Plus also recently raised its price by $1 a month, this makes the Disney Plus-Hulu-ESPN Plus bundle an even better bargain than before.
                <br><br> Hulu currently has 42.8 million subscribers, all based in the US. The current $5.99 a month price tag for the ad-supported version is one of the best deals in streaming for an individual service. It will be interesting to see
                if Hulu loses some subscribers after this change. This is the first change in Hulu’s prices since early 2019.
